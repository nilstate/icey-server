# icey-server Demo

This is the fastest end-to-end path through the icey media stack:

- C++ source-to-browser server
- bundled web UI
- Symple signalling over WebSocket
- embedded TURN relay
- real browser playback with a shipped demo source

This is the one place to point people for the demo.

One command. One URL. One click.

## Express Path

The fastest way to try the demo is the published image.

This path targets Linux with host networking:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host 0state/icey-server:latest
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4500
```

Click `Watch` on the `icey` peer. The image ships with `data/test.mp4` as the default stream source, so the browser should start receiving video immediately.

## Source Path

If you want the repo-backed path for local edits or local artifacts, use Compose from this directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4500
```

## What This Runs

The published image and the local Compose build package:

- the `icey-server` application
- the production web UI build from `icey-server/web/`
- the sample media file at `data/test.mp4`

The published image is available as `0state/icey-server:latest`.

The local Compose path reuses the existing local build artifacts instead of recompiling inside Docker, so rebuilds stay cheap.

If your current binary lives in a different build tree, point Docker at it directly:

```bash
ICEY_SERVER_BINARY=icey-server/build-dev/src/server/icey-server docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The server starts in `stream` mode by default and listens on:

- HTTP / WebSocket: `4500`
- TURN: `3478` TCP and UDP

## Why Host Networking

This demo is meant to prove real WebRTC and TURN behavior, not just serve HTML.

Docker bridge networking hides the host-facing ICE and relay addresses the browser needs. `network_mode: host` keeps the advertised addresses honest on Linux, which is the path that consistently proves the full stack.

## Runtime Overrides

You can switch the app mode or input source with environment variables.

Published image examples:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -e ICEY_MODE=record -v "$(pwd)/recordings:/app/recordings" 0state/icey-server:latest
docker run --rm --network host -e ICEY_MODE=relay 0state/icey-server:latest
docker run --rm --network host -e ICEY_SOURCE=rtsp://camera.local/stream1 -e ICEY_LOOP=0 0state/icey-server:latest
```

Compose examples:

```bash
ICEY_MODE=record docker compose up --build
ICEY_MODE=relay docker compose up --build
ICEY_SOURCE=/app/media/test.mp4 docker compose up --build
```

For the Compose path, `record` mode writes files into:

```text
icey-server/docker/recordings/
```

For the published image path, `record` mode writes wherever you bind-mount `/app/recordings`.

## Notes

- This is the canonical `icey-server` demo for the self-hosted media stack.
- The express path is `docker run --rm --network host 0state/icey-server:latest`.
- The source path is `docker compose up --build` from this directory.
- For direct local use, open `http://localhost:4500`.
- The local Compose build expects the existing `icey-server/build-dev/src/server/icey-server` binary and `icey-server/web/dist/` output to be present.
- The default local Compose context assumes sibling `icey-server/` and `icey/` checkouts so the demo media file can be copied from `icey/data/test.mp4`.
- If port `4500` or `3478` is already busy on the host, free it first or override `ICEY_PORT` / `ICEY_TURN_PORT`.
- For remote NAT testing, set `ICEY_TURN_EXTERNAL_IP` so embedded TURN advertises the right public address.
- Docker Desktop host networking is not the primary target here. For non-Linux hosts, use the native app README first.
